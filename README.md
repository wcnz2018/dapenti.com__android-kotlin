There is a website I like very much, which is http://www.dapenti.com

The official App for Android is awful, so I decided to write one for myself.

The idea is quite simple, grab pages from the site, categorise them, store them and present them, html content can be altered when showing in order to provide features like ads-blocking and day/night mode.

I've been a fan of the website for years, it's not my intention to hurt the owner's interests, if it did, please let me know.

Here are some screenshots
